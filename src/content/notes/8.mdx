If you didn't know <Code code={`git add`} lang="shell" theme="tokyo-night" inline /> have some options, one of them is <Code code={`-p`} lang="shell" theme="tokyo-night" inline /> which allows you to stage changes interactively.
This is great when you are working with a file/project with multiple changes and want to commit only some of them.
Each patch is visually presented and you can choose to either:

y - stage current patch

n - do not stage current patch

q - quit; which result in not staging current and all the following patches

a - stage current and all following patches

d - do not stage current and following patches

e - manually edit current patch

? - help

It's a great way to review your changes before committing them.
