Who knows me, knows I love basketball. And the NBA season is back! 🏀
It's been already a few days since the season started and I'm excited to see how the teams will perform this year.

From what I've seen so far:

- The Lakers are looking like a completely different team (especially on offense) with JJ Redick as their new HC.
- Golden State Warriors have a deep roster and might surprise a lot of people who counted them out.
- Celtics, Mavericks, Wolves OKC and Cavaliers are probably top 5 teams in the league right now.
- Youth is knocking on the door: Magic and Rockets are much better this year and might stir the pot in their respective conferences.
- Bucks will continue to suck with Doc Rivers as their HC. I'm sorry, but it's true.
- 76ers are a mess with all the injuries, but if they get healthy they might have some good runs this season.

Let's see what the season brings us! 🏀🔥
