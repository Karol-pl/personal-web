Hello in 2025!

So some time ago I've started contemplating transitioning from vscode to neovim.
But I wasn't fully commited, until now.
I'm still not efficient enought to use it as my main editor at work but every side project (including this site) is created/maintained with it.

In the comming weeks I plan to fully transition, so far it's been fun, the key is as usual: consistency!
If you are interested in making that switch as well I recommend checking out projects like AstroNvim or kickstart.nvim as they might provide a smoother transition.
