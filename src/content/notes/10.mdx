If you follow NBA you already know. Lakers and Mavs traded their best players in Anthony Davis and Luka Doncic (There was more players, draft picks and another team involved but I want to keep it short so I'll focus on those two).

First of all, Niko Harrison (the orchestrator of the deal on Mavs side) has big balls. He had to know he's going to end up as an enemy no.1 in Dallas after trading their franchise player in Luka. At the same time, big balls doesn't mean big brain. If you as a GM don't belive anymore that your superstar can get you a championship, you should explore all trade options, do a bidding - I'm sure there would be a lot of teams going all in for a player like this. For someone like Luka Doncic you should get gazilion draft picks and some really good players too. But that wasn't the case as they kept trade talks under wraps. Dallas ended with Anthony Davis - great player, future hall of famer, but prone to injuries and already 31 years old. So maybe he thought that trade might give them championship this year (which is true, they definetely have championship caliber team roster right now, the problem is they already struggle with injuries and AD is hurt too after just one game!!). Long term it's just not a good deal, period. Luka Doncic is 25, multiple all-nba, one of the best players in the league right now and not even in his prime!

Second, I didn't think high of Rob Pelinka (GM of Lakers) before this trade but it was a masterpiece for the organization (although I'm not sure if it's luck, skills or mixture of both). At the end of the day they get an amazing, young superstar, and stay with LeBron on the roster who maybe is old and at the end of his career but he knows a thing or two about the longetivity and preparedness - the thing that Luka struggles the most with and apparently the main reason for the trade to happen. Also, they didn't gave out all the draft picks so the future looks really bright for them.

Overall, there's no doubt that Lakers are the winners of this trade, even if this season Dallas gets healthy and even goes to finals and end up with a championship I think long term we will remember that Mavs gave their biggest superstar (those franchise players come very rarely) for one, maybe two good seasons. As far as for the Lakers, I don't think they have championship roster this season, but if they get a new center they might be a serious contender in the near future.
