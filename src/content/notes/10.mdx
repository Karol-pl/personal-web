If you follow NBA you already know. Lakers and Mavs traded their best players in Anthony Davis and Luka Doncic (There was more players, draft picks and another team involved but I want to keep it short so I'll focus on those two).

First of all, Niko Harrison (the orchestrator of the deal on Mavs side) has big balls. He had to know he's going to end up as an enemy no.1 in Dallas after trading their franchise player in Luka. At the same time, big balls doesn't mean big brain. If you as a GM don't belive anymore that your superstar can get you a championship, you should explore all trade options, and for someone like Luka Doncic you should get gazilion draft picks and some star too. But that wasn't the case as they kept trade talks under wraps. And Dallas ended with Anthony Davis - great player, future hall of famer, but prone to injuries and already 31 years old. So maybe he thought that trade might give them championship this year (which is true, they definetely have championship caliber team roster right now, the problem is they already struggle with injuries and AD is hurt too after just one game!!). Long term it's just not a good deal, period. Luka Doncic is 25, multiple all-nba, one of the best players in the league right now and not even in his prime!

Second, I didn't think high of Rob Pelinka (GM of Lakers) but this trade was amazing for them (although I'm not sure if it's luck, skills or mixture of both). At the end of the day they get an amazing, young superstar, and stay with LeBron on the roster who maybe is old and at the end of his career but he can make Luka even better by teaching him about longetivity, taking care of his body (which Luka struggles with). Also, they didn't gave out all the future draft picks so their future looks really bright.

Overall, there's no doubt that Lakers are the winners of this trade, even if this season Dallas gets healthy and gets a championship I think long term we will remember that Mavs gave their biggest superstar (those franchise players come very rarely, and if you are lucky to get them) for one good season. As far as lakers go, I don't think they have championship roster this season, but if they get a new center they might be a serious contender in the near future.
