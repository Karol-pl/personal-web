import { Code } from "astro:components";

So, I've been using Next.js for a while now and I always liked Netlify more than Vercel (It's a preference thing, I guess).
But, keeping the site up-to-date with the latest Next.js versions is becoming quite uncomfortable with Netlify.

There's some things to complain about. But there's also one big positive I would like to mention, an initiative that makes it possible for me (and many more)
to use my go to tools together, <a href="https://opennext.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>OpenNext</span></a>.
Their adapter for Netlify (now maintained by Netlify team) is working great, although I'm not a fan of <Code code={`.html`} lang="html" theme="tokyo-night" inline />
copy of the forms required for Netlify to pick up the forms you might have on your site (required if you use Netlify forms). I am really grateful for all the work done to keep Next.js open to different options than Vercel.
