I've been using neovim for over 2 months now. I'm getting a hang of it more and more each day. I'm definetely no speed demon yet but I'll get there. There's some things I've already noticed:

- Navigating through files/project is ridiculous compared to vsc.
- My mouse usage gets down fast.
- Doing everything from terminal (with tmux) is convenient!
- On larger project there's no slow down/lag.
