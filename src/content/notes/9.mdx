I've been using neovim for over 2 months now. I'm getting a hang of it more and more each day. I'm definetely no speed demon yet but I'll get there. There's some things I've already noticed:

- Navigating through files/project is so much faster compared to vsc I can't even explain.
- Mouse usage gets down fast (as you get more used to doing things on keyboard).
- Having everything in terminal (with tmux) is convenient!
- On larger projects there's no slow down/lag which is noticeable with vsc.
