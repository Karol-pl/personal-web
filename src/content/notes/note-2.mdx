import { Code } from "astro:components";

Do you ever get tired of writing multiple lines of css (including media queries)
to get your container to work how you would want it?
Well, here's a nice little one liner that solves a lot:

<Code
  lang="css"
  code={`width: min(100%, [<your-max-width>]);`}
  inline
  theme="tokyo-night"
/>

Okay, so what does this do?
It sets the width of the container to the minimum of 100% of the parent container
or the max width you want to set.

This is great because it means you don't have to write media queries to make
sure your container doesn't go over a certain width on smaller screens.

Also, you can add inline margin when you need to, like so:

<Code
  lang="css"
  code={`width: min(100% - [<your-smaller-devices-inline-margin>], [<your-max-width>]);`}
  inline
  theme="tokyo-night"
/>
