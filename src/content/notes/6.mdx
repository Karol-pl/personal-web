Well, this season has been a rollercoaster so far.

- West is being dominated by the youth, with teams like **OKC**, **Grizzlies**, **Rockets** and **Mavs** leading the conference,
- Trailing them are the **Warriors** and **Nuggets**. Both teams are playing well, but they struggle at times with being too dependent on their stars (SC, Jokic).
- On the top of the East, we have **Cavs**, **Celtics**, **Magic** and **Knicks**. All the teams are well balanced with multiple players contributing to their success.
- **Heat** and **Bucks** are trying to keep up, but I'm not sure they have enough of talent to put up a fight against top teams.

Those are top 6 teams in each conference right now. With the trade deadline approaching, I'm pretty sure there's going to be some movement especially in the middle teams who are trying to make a push for the playoffs.
